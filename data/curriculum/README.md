Curriculum outputs
==================

This directory is generated by `scripts/build_curriculum.py`:

- `train_curriculum.jsonl`: seeds (ordered) followed by train.jsonl. Seeds are not shuffled; train can be optionally shuffled via `--shuffle-train`.
- `eval_curriculum.jsonl`: copy of eval files; never used for training.

Usage:
- Run `python3 scripts/build_curriculum.py` (add `--shuffle-train` to shuffle train rows; seeds stay ordered).
- Load seeds first, then train rows. Keep eval separate for evaluation only.

Preprocessing for training:
- Run `python3 scripts/preprocess_for_training.py` to emit `data/processed/train_prompts.jsonl` and `data/processed/eval_prompts.jsonl` with fields `{prompt, output}`.
- `prompt` = instruction + blank line + input (if input non-empty); `output` = target text.
- Metadata/ids are dropped by default; pass `--keep-metadata` to retain them.
