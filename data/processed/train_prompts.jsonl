When a new prey q_new appears, META creates GEOMETRY(predator near q_new, radius=80), EPISTEMIC(predator senses q_new), and DYNAMICS(predator, chase_target=q_new) for each predator.

This keeps actuation rules bound to safety constraints."}
{"prompt": "Describe a META rule that enforces ONTOLOGY schemas on new entities.", "output": "META listens for entity creation.

{"prompt": "Describe a META rule that triggers GCO closure when production occurs.", "output": "META watches for Production events (e.g., new relation/entity creation or external act).
