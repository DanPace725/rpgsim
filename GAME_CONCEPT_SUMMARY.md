## Core Elements & Resources

### Aurelia (Primary Power Element)
- A rare and valuable resource that generates energy through direct contact with certain metallic elements
- Produces energy pulses when contacting compatible metals
- The strength and duration depend on metal type and amount of Aurelia present
- Can manipulate generated energy to perform various functions:
  - Power machines and lifting systems
  - Create energy shields and weapons
  - Fuel magical abilities and spells

### Arcite Crystals (Energy Storage)
- Crystalline element that stores energy produced by Aurelia
- Can store large amounts of energy
- Storage capacity depends on size and purity
- Can manipulate stored energy for various functions
- The combination of Aurelia and arcite creates a powerful, versatile resource system

### Special Metals
- Various metals with unique properties when combined with Aurelia
- Some become intense electromagnets when electrically charged
- Rare and valuable, discovery of new metal types could be major plot points
- Only certain metals are compatible with Aurelia's energy generation

- Scaling difficulty while maintaining accessibility

---

## Conclusion

This game concept presents a unique fusion of:
- **Post-apocalyptic exploration** in diverse, beautiful biomes
- **Coding-inspired magic** that rewards creativity and experimentation  
- **Morally complex AI factions** with no clear "good guys"
- **Dynamic narrative** shaped by meaningful player choices
