# Relational Primitives

You said Quote: " Late-stage capitalism fails P4 and P6 (ethical constraint + relational stewardship)
Nihilism fails P5 (epistemic coupling)
Deconstructionism fails P1 (ontological identity)
Postmodern relativism fails everything
Rigid materialism fails P2, P5
Hard dualism fails P3
Fundamentalist religiosity fails P4
Idealism fails P2"... Wait, hold on did you just use the relational Primitives to demonstrate why certain ideas or systems can't be compatible with the essence of E^2? Lol.
