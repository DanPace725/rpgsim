# Relational Coherence Navigator
The Relational Coherence Navigator is a lightweight browser-based tool that helps users understand the structural coherence of complex life situations. It evaluates user input across five relational dimensions:
1. Continuity2. Differentiation3. Contextual Fit4. Accountability5. Reflexivity
This repository contains the minimal implementation required for an interactive prototype using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
## Features
- Single-page interface- LLM-powered relational evaluation- Structured JSON analysis- Fast iteration and agent-friendly codebase- No frameworks or build steps required
## Project Structure
See file descriptions in `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS_START_HERE.md`.
## How to Use
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x (for running the local development server)- An OpenAI API key (get one from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
### Local Development Setup
1. **Create the environment file:**
   ```bash   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here" > .env   ```
   Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.
2. **Start the local development server:**
   ```bash   python -m http.server 8000   ```
3. **Open your browser and navigate to:**
   ```text   http://localhost:8000   ```
### Why a Server is Required
This application cannot be run by simply opening `index.html` in a browser because:
- The JavaScript needs to fetch the `.env` file to access your API key- Browsers block direct file access for security reasons (CORS policy)- A local web server serves all files including the `.env` file, allowing the JavaScript to access it
### Testing the Setup
1. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser2. Type a situation description in the text area3. Click "Evaluate"4. You should see a JSON response with coherence scores across the five dimensions
## Deployment to Vercel
### Quick Deploy
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository2. Import the project in [Vercel](https://vercel.com)3. Add your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:   - Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables   - Add: `OPENAI_API_KEY` = `your_openai_api_key_here`4. Deploy!
### How It Works
- **Local Development**: Uses `.env` file and direct OpenAI API calls- **Production (Vercel)**: Uses serverless function at `/api/evaluate` that securely accesses environment variables- The code automatically detects the environment and uses the appropriate method
### Vercel Environment Variables
In your Vercel project settings, add:
| Name | Value ||------|-------|| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key |
Make sure to add it to all environments (Production, Preview, Development) as needed.
## Status
Early prototype scaffolding.
