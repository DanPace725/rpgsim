# Relational Primitives V3

# **Relational Ontology Derived from First Principles**

## **A Systematic Extraction of Cross-Domain Relational Structure**

---

**Abstract**

This paper develops a relational ontology grounded in systematic extraction from Matter, Energy, and Spacetime. Through structured decomposition and functional clustering, we identify approximately thirty recurring relationship types across physics domains and organize them into six relational primitives: Ontological, Dynamical, Geometric/Causal, Symmetric/Constraint, Epistemic/Informational, and Meta-Relational.

We demonstrate that these primitives are functionally independent (no primitive can be expressed in terms of the others) and jointly sufficient (they cover the extracted relationship types). The derivation process is documented in detail in Appendix A, providing transparency into clustering decisions and alternative groupings considered.

The resulting framework offers domain-agnostic relational vocabulary that may support interdisciplinary modeling, conceptual clarity in physics, and future work on emergent relational structures. While derived from contemporary physics, the primitives are presented as working categories subject to refinement rather than metaphysical absolutes.

**1. Introduction**

**1.1 Motivation**

Modern physics describes the universe through diverse conceptual structures: quantum fields, particles, energy distributions, geometric manifolds, causal networks, conservation laws, and informational constraints. Despite this diversity, physics remains fundamentally relational. Entities interact, transform, govern, constrain, and inform each other in structured ways.

Yet physics lacks a unified relational vocabulary. Quantum mechanics, general relativity, thermodynamics, and field theory each employ domain-specific relational concepts that resist straightforward comparison. This fragmentation obscures potential structural commonalities and complicates cross-domain reasoning.

This work addresses that gap by systematically extracting relational structures from foundational physical domains and organizing them into a minimal set of relational primitives.

**1.2 Objectives**

We aim to:

1. Extract recurring relationship types from Matter, Energy, and Spacetime
2. Organize these types into functionally coherent clusters
3. Derive a minimal set of relational primitives sufficient to describe the extracted structures
4. Demonstrate the independence and coverage of these primitives
5. Document the derivation process transparently

**1.3 Scope and Limitations**

This work does not propose new physics. Rather, it analyzes how existing physics describes reality to identify recurring relational patterns. The resulting ontology represents current physical understanding and may evolve as physics develops.

We explicitly do not claim:

- Metaphysical necessity of these particular primitives
- Completeness beyond the domains analyzed
- Uniqueness of this particular clustering

We do claim:

- Systematic derivation from recognizable physical structures
- Functional independence of the resulting primitives
- Potential utility for cross-domain reasoning

**2. Related Work**

**2.1 Relational Physics and Foundations**

Several physical frameworks emphasize relational structure:

- **Relational quantum mechanics** (Rovelli, 1996) treats quantum states as relational properties
- **General relativity** couples geometry and matter relationally
- **Gauge theories** define particles through symmetry relationships
- **Causal set theory** treats causal relations as fundamental
- **Machian dynamics** grounds motion in relative configurations

Our work aligns with these traditions while attempting broader extraction across domains.

**2.2 Category-Theoretic Approaches**

Category theory provides tools for describing systems via morphisms rather than objects:

- Categorical quantum mechanics (Abramsky & Coecke, 2004)
- Functorial field theories (Baez & Stay, 2011)
- Monoidal categories in compositional physics

While we do not formalize categorically here, the resulting primitives map naturally to categorical structures (objects, morphisms, constraints, functors).

**2.3 Systems Theory and Complexity Science**

Systems theory emphasizes interactions, constraints, information flow, and emergent dynamics. Our primitives overlap with these emphases but are grounded directly in physical relational structures rather than abstract system principles.

**2.4 Structural Realism**

Structural realism (Ladyman & Ross, 2007; French & Ladyman, 2003) argues that physical theories describe relational structures rather than intrinsic properties. Our approach operationalizes this view by explicitly extracting and organizing those relational structures.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Domain Decomposition**

We begin by decomposing three primary physical domains—Matter, Energy, and Spacetime—into constituent sub-objects and known relational structures, relying on established physical theory.

**Matter (M)** includes:

- Baryonic matter (protons, neutrons, atoms)
- Antimatter (antiparticles)
- Leptonic matter (electrons, neutrinos)
- Dark matter (CDM, axions, WIMPs)
- Quantum fields as matter substrates

**Energy (E)** includes:

- Kinetic and potential energy
- Radiation (photons, EM waves)
- Field energy (stored in EM, Higgs, inflaton fields)
- Dark energy (cosmological constant, quintessence)
- Vacuum energy (zero-point fluctuations)

**Spacetime (S)** includes:

- 4D manifold structure
- Metric tensor
- Curvature tensors (Ricci, Riemann, Weyl)
- Stress-energy tensor
- Causal structure (light cones, horizons)
- Quantum spacetime proposals (spin networks, strings, causal sets)

For each subdomain, we catalog internal relationships and cross-domain connections.

**3.2 Cross-Domain Relational Extraction**

Internal relational vocabularies from each domain are compared to identify recurring patterns. A relational type is retained if:

- It appears in multiple domains, OR
- It bridges domains essentially (e.g., stress-energy ↔︎ curvature)

This yields approximately thirty fundamental relationship types. (See Appendix A for exhaustive list and extraction tables.)

**3.3 Functional Clustering**

Extracted relational types are grouped by functional similarity—the role they play in physical descriptions. Clustering criteria include:

- **Functional role**: What does this relationship accomplish? (e.g., defining identity vs. governing change)
- **Mathematical structure**: Do relationships share formal properties?
- **Epistemic role**: Do they serve similar descriptive functions?
- **Cross-domain applicability**: Does the functional role transfer across domains?

This process is iterative. We consider alternative clusterings, evaluate functional distinctness, and test whether merged or split categories lose or gain expressiveness. (Detailed clustering decisions are documented in Appendix A.)

**3.4 Derivation of Relational Primitives**

A relational primitive is defined as a cluster that:

1. Cannot be decomposed further without collapsing essential distinctions
2. Is necessary for describing at least two physical domains
3. Has no functional substitute among other clusters

Applying these criteria yields six relational primitives.

---

**4. Results**

**4.1 The Extracted Relationship Types**

The cross-domain extraction produced approximately thirty relational types, including:

**Structural/Ontological**: identity, composition, emergence, structural hierarchy, equivalence

**Dynamical**: interaction, coupling, transformation, evolution, force, flow

**Geometric/Causal**: embedding, curvature, geodesics, causal propagation, light cones, topology

**Symmetric/Constraint**: gauge symmetry, conservation laws, invariance, duality, constraints

**Informational/Epistemic**: measurement, uncertainty, entropy, decoherence, information flow, observability

**Meta-Relational**: functorial mappings, renormalization group flows, cross-domain correspondence, recursive structure

These types represent the relational vocabulary needed to describe Matter, Energy, and Spacetime across contemporary physics.

**4.2 The Six Relational Primitives**

The thirty types cluster into six meta-categories:

**1. Ontological Primitive**

**Function**: Defines what entities are

**Examples**: identity, structure, composition, existence conditions, modal properties

**Physical instances**: particle identity, field ontology, structural hierarchy (quarks → protons → atoms)

**2. Dynamical Primitive**

**Function**: Defines how entities change and interact

**Examples**: evolution, interaction, coupling, transformation, forces

**Physical instances**: Hamiltonian evolution, field interactions, geodesic motion, decay processes

**3. Geometric/Causal Primitive**

**Function**: Defines where/when entities exist and how influence propagates

**Examples**: spatial embedding, temporal ordering, causal structure, curvature, topology

**Physical instances**: spacetime manifold, metric tensor, light cones, geodesics, causal horizons

**4. Symmetric/Constraint Primitive**

**Function**: Defines rules that govern structure and behavior

**Examples**: symmetries, conservation laws, gauge invariance, constraints, dualities

**Physical instances**: Noether's theorem, CPT symmetry, diffeomorphism invariance, charge conservation

**5. Epistemic/Informational Primitive**

**Function**: Defines what can be known, measured, or computed

**Examples**: measurement, uncertainty, entropy, information encoding, observability

**Physical instances**: quantum measurement, thermodynamic entropy, holographic principle, decoherence

**6. Meta-Relational Primitive**

**Function**: Defines relationships between relational structures

**Examples**: functorial mappings, cross-domain correspondence, renormalization group flows, recursive structure

**Physical instances**: duality transformations, effective field theories, correspondence principles, emergence

**4.3 Interpretation**

These primitives appear consistently across physical models and provide sufficient abstraction to describe relational structure without committing to specific mathematical formalisms. They are not claimed to be metaphysically necessary but represent natural functional groupings within contemporary physics.

---

**5. Formal Demonstration of Independence and Coverage**

This section provides formal justification for two claims:

1. **Coverage**: The six primitives jointly describe all extracted relationship types
2. **Independence**: No primitive can be expressed in terms of the others

**5.1 Formal Setup**

Let **R** = {r₁, r₂, ..., r₃₀} be the set of extracted relationship types.

Let **P** = {Ont, Dyn, Geo, Sym, Epi, Meta} be the six relational primitives.

Define:

- A relationship type r is **covered** by primitive p if r can be functionally instantiated within p's scope
- A primitive p is **independent** if its functional role cannot be reconstructed from P \ {p}

**5.2 Demonstration of Coverage**

**Claim**: Every relationship type r ∈ R is covered by at least one primitive p ∈ P.

**Argument**:

| **Relationship Type** | **Covering Primitive** |
| --- | --- |
| Identity, composition, structural hierarchy, emergence, modal properties | Ontological |
| Interaction, coupling, transformation, evolution, force, flow | Dynamical |
| Embedding, curvature, geodesics, causal propagation, light cones, topology | Geometric/Causal |
| Symmetry, conservation, gauge invariance, constraints, duality | Symmetric/Constraint |
| Measurement, uncertainty, entropy, decoherence, information flow, observability | Epistemic/Informational |
| Functorial mapping, renormalization, cross-domain correspondence, recursive structure | Meta-Relational |

By construction, R was partitioned into functional clusters that became P. Thus R ⊆ ⋃ P, establishing coverage.

**5.3 Demonstration of Independence via Counter-Mode Analysis**

To demonstrate that primitives are functionally independent, we employ a **counter-mode strategy**: for each primitive, we construct a relational scenario that primitive can describe but no other primitive can.

**Counter-Mode Pairs**

For each primitive X, we define complementary modes X⁺ and X⁻ that create a distinctive **modal fingerprint** M₄(X):

**Ontological (Ont)**:

- Ont⁺: Elementary/atomic entities (fundamental particles, spacetime points)
- Ont⁻: Composite/emergent entities (atoms, macroscopic objects, effective fields)
- Modal fingerprint M₄(Ont) = distinguishes what-is from what-emerges

**Dynamical (Dyn)**:

- Dyn⁺: Deterministic evolution (Hamiltonian mechanics, unitary QM evolution)
- Dyn⁻: Stochastic/dissipative dynamics (thermalization, decoherence, measurement)
- Modal fingerprint M₄(Dyn) = distinguishes reversible from irreversible change

**Geometric/Causal (Geo)**:

- Geo⁺: Local/proximate structure (local curvature, nearby causation)
- Geo⁻: Global/nonlocal structure (topology, distant entanglement, black hole interiors)
- Modal fingerprint M₄(Geo) = distinguishes local from holistic structure

**Symmetric/Constraint (Sym)**:

- Sym⁺: Preserved symmetries (conserved quantities, exact gauge invariance)
- Sym⁻: Broken symmetries (spontaneous breaking, anomalies, phase transitions)
- Modal fingerprint M₄(Sym) = distinguishes what's forbidden from what's allowed

**Epistemic/Informational (Epi)**:

- Epi⁺: Observable/accessible (classical regime, macroscopic measurement)
- Epi⁻: Hidden/inaccessible (quantum coherence, black hole interior, dark matter properties)
- Modal fingerprint M₄(Epi) = distinguishes knowable from fundamentally uncertain

**Meta-Relational (Meta)**:

- Meta⁺: Preserved structure under mapping (dualities, correspondence limits)
- Meta⁻: Emergent structure under coarse-graining (effective theories, renormalization)
- Modal fingerprint M₄(Meta) = distinguishes exact correspondence from approximation

**Independence Proof Structure**

**Claim**: For any distinct primitives p, p' ∈ P, M₄(p) ≠ M₄(p')

**Argument**: Each modal fingerprint captures a functional distinction that the other primitives cannot express:

- **M₄(Ont)** distinguishes ontological levels → No other primitive distinguishes elementary from composite as a *what-is* question
- **M₄(Dyn)** distinguishes temporal evolution modes → No other primitive captures reversibility as a *how-it-changes* question
- **M₄(Geo)** distinguishes spatial/causal scope → No other primitive captures locality as a *where/when* question
- **M₄(Sym)** distinguishes allowed vs. forbidden → No other primitive captures preservation as a *what's-constrained* question
- **M₄(Epi)** distinguishes accessible vs. hidden → No other primitive captures observability as a *what's-knowable* question
- **M₄(Meta)** distinguishes exact vs. approximate mapping → No other primitive captures correspondence as a *how-frameworks-relate* question

Therefore, the primitives are functionally independent under first-order definability.

**5.4 Result**

Given the extraction methodology and functional analysis:

1. **Coverage**: The six primitives jointly describe all thirty relationship types
2. **Minimality**: Removing any primitive reduces coverage (shown by counter-mode examples)
3. **Independence**: No primitive's function can be reconstructed from the others (shown by modal fingerprints)

This provides structural justification for treating the six primitives as a working relational ontology for physics.

**6. Discussion**

**6.1 Alignment with Category-Theoretic Structures**

The primitives map naturally to categorical concepts:

- **Ontological** ≈ objects in a category
- **Dynamical** ≈ morphisms (arrows)
- **Geometric/Causal** ≈ monoidal structure or indexing
- **Symmetric/Constraint** ≈ natural transformations, functorial invariants
- **Epistemic/Informational** ≈ adjoint structure, enrichment, or probabilistic functors
- **Meta-Relational** ≈ functors between categories

This alignment suggests the primitives capture deep structural necessities implied by compositional reasoning rather than arbitrary taxonomic choices.

**6.2 Applications to Systems Theory and Complexity Science**

From a systems perspective, the primitives function as:

- Identity constraints (Ontological)
- State-transition rules (Dynamical)
- Embedding and coupling structure (Geometric/Causal)
- Governing invariants (Symmetric/Constraint)
- Information flow and measurement limits (Epistemic/Informational)
- Inter-system connectivity (Meta-Relational)

This suggests the framework may transfer to biological, computational, and social systems where similar relational structures appear.

**6.3 Implications for Cognitive and AI Architecture**

Because cognition involves distributed interacting processes, the primitives may offer structural grammar for mental phenomena:

- **Ontological**: conceptual identity, mental objects, schemas
- **Dynamical**: cognitive transitions, inference, belief updating
- **Geometric/Causal**: attentional space, temporal binding, context
- **Symmetric/Constraint**: priors, rational constraints, homeostatic regulation
- **Epistemic/Informational**: uncertainty representation, evidence accumulation, sensory integration
- **Meta-Relational**: metacognition, analogical reasoning, model comparison

This parallel structure suggests cognition may employ similar relational primitives to physics for organizing information and generating behavior.

**6.4 Limitations and Future Directions**

Several limitations warrant emphasis:

1. **Derivation scope**: The primitives are extracted from contemporary physics and may not generalize to fundamentally new physical theories
2. **Granularity**: Six categories represent one level of abstraction; finer or coarser groupings might serve different purposes
3. **Formalization**: While the primitives map to categorical structures, full categorical formalization remains future work
4. **Metaphysical neutrality**: We make no claim about whether these categories reflect mind-independent structure vs. useful human organizational schemes

Future work might:

- Develop full categorical formulation
- Test applicability to biological and social systems
- Explore higher-order constructs (patterns, meta-stability, phase transitions)
- Investigate whether AI systems naturally develop similar relational structure

---

**7. Conclusion**

Through systematic extraction from Matter, Energy, and Spacetime, we have derived six relational primitives that organize recurring structures in physics: Ontological, Dynamical, Geometric/Causal, Symmetric/Constraint, Epistemic/Informational, and Meta-Relational.

These primitives are functionally independent (demonstrated via modal fingerprints) and jointly sufficient (covering all extracted relationship types). The derivation process is documented transparently in Appendix A, providing foundation for critique and refinement.

The resulting framework offers domain-agnostic relational vocabulary suitable for cross-disciplinary work. While grounded in contemporary physics, the primitives are presented as working categories rather than metaphysical absolutes, subject to refinement as physical understanding evolves.

The convergence of this physics-grounded ontology with categorical structures, systems theory, and potentially cognitive architecture suggests these primitives may capture genuinely general relational patterns rather than domain-specific artifacts.

**The Global Closure Operator (GCO)**

In the previous sections, we established the six relational primitives—Ontological, Dynamical, Geometric/Causal, Symmetric/Constraint, Epistemic/Informational, and Meta-Relational—as a minimal and independent basis for describing relational structure.
In this section, we introduce a construct that arises naturally when these primitives operate jointly. We call this the **Global Closure Operator (GCO)**. The GCO captures the principle that a generative relational system tends toward a state of **sufficiency** or **stability**, where further application of the primitives no longer produces qualitatively new structural kinds, but rather maintains the existing relational order.
Crucially, the GCO is **not** a seventh primitive. It is a system-wide meta-principle of stability that emerges from the combined action of the six primitives, providing a boundary condition for their use.

**6.1 Intuitive Role of the GCO**

Informally, the GCO expresses the transition from **genesis** to **homeostasis**.
Given a system where the six primitives are fully specified and allowed to interact, there exists a regime where the system "closes" on itself. At this point, the ontology is stable, the dynamics are bounded by constraints, and the epistemic access is well-defined. The system shifts from a mode of **unbounded expansion** to a mode of **self-consistent operation**.
The GCO plays a role analogous to:
• **Equilibrium** in thermodynamics (where net flows cease despite particle motion).
• **Homeostasis** in biology (where an organism maintains internal stability despite external flux).
• **Fixed Points** in recursive logic and domain theory.
• **"Rest"** in narrative or ethical frameworks (the cessation of striving once sufficiency is reached).

**6.2 Formal Setting**

Let $P = \{O, D, G, S, E, M\}$ denote the set of six relational primitives. We define a relational model $\mathcal{M}$ over $P$ as a triple $\mathcal{M} = (D, R, I)$, where $D$ is a domain of entities, $R$ is a set of relations, and $I$ is the interpretation of the primitives.
We define a Primitive-Expansion Operator $Exp_P$:
$$Exp_P: \mathcal{M} \mapsto \mathcal{M}'$$
This operator applies the six primitives to the model, generating implied structures (e.g., deducing composite objects via $O$, propagating causal influences via $G$, or removing forbidden states via $S$).
Refinement on Monotonicity:
We assume that $Exp_P$ is Monotone with respect to Structural Determination.
We define an ordering $\preceq$ where $\mathcal{M}_A \preceq \mathcal{M}_B$ implies that $\mathcal{M}_B$ is more relationally determined than $\mathcal{M}_A$.
• *Note:* This does not necessarily mean $\mathcal{M}_B$ has "more stuff" (matter/energy). Indeed, the Symmetric/Constraint primitive ($S$) often *reduces* the state space by eliminating forbidden configurations.
• Therefore, Monotonicity here means the system moves from **Ambiguity/Potentiality** toward **Specificity/Definition**.

**6.3 Definition of the GCO**

Consider the sequence obtained by iterating the expansion operator:
$$\mathcal{M}_0, \ \mathcal{M}_1 = Exp_P(\mathcal{M}_0), \ \dots$$
Under standard conditions of physical and logical consistency, this sequence approaches a Fixed Point $\mathcal{M}^*$ such that:
$$Exp_P(\mathcal{M}^*) = \mathcal{M}^*$$
At this state, the application of ontology, dynamics, constraints, etc., yields a model isomorphic to the current state. The system has defined itself completely.
Definition (Global Closure Operator):
The Global Closure Operator $C_P$ acts on the state space of all possible models, mapping an initial model $\mathcal{M}_0$ to its nearest stable fixed point:
$$C_P(\mathcal{M}_0) = \mathcal{M}^* \quad \text{such that} \quad Exp_P(\mathcal{M}^*) = \mathcal{M}^*$$
Intuitively, $C_P$ represents the mapping of any transient system to its **Basin of Attraction**.

**6.4 Properties**

As a formal Closure Operator, the GCO satisfies:
1. **Extensiveness:** $\mathcal{M}_0 \preceq C_P(\mathcal{M}_0)$ (The closed state is more determined than the initial state).
2. **Monotonicity:** If $\mathcal{M}_A \preceq \mathcal{M}_B$, then $C_P(\mathcal{M}_A) \preceq C_P(\mathcal{M}_B)$ (Structural determination is preserved).
3. **Idempotence:** $C_P(C_P(\mathcal{M}_0)) = C_P(\mathcal{M}_0)$ (Once stable, the system remains stable unless externally perturbed).

**6.5 Metastability and the Landscape of Closure**

While the operator is "Global" in that it applies to the entire state space, it does not imply a single universal outcome. Complex physical and cognitive systems inhabit a **Relational Landscape** containing multiple possible stable states.
Metastability:
A closure $\mathcal{M}^*$ is often locally stable rather than globally unique. The system resists small perturbations (e.g., a cell repairing damage), but sufficient energy or structural reorganization can force the system out of $\mathcal{M}^*$ and into a new basin of attraction $\mathcal{M}^{**}$.
Phase Transitions:
This allows the GCO to model developmental and evolutionary change. A "Phase Transition" occurs when the parameters of the underlying primitives (specifically the Meta-Relational or Symmetric constraints) shift, altering the landscape of fixed points.
• **Example (Physics):** Water molecules reach a closure at "Ice" ($\mathcal{M}^*_{ice}$). If thermal energy increases (Dynamical shift), the system exits this closure and finds a new fixed point at "Liquid Water" ($\mathcal{M}^*_{liquid}$).
• **Example (Cognition):** An intelligence may reach a closure of "Pattern Matching" ($\mathcal{M}^*_{reflex}$). If the system develops sufficient internal complexity to model itself (Meta-Relational shift), it transitions to a new closure of "Self-Reflection" ($\mathcal{M}^*_{agent}$).
The Gradient of Meaningful Existence:
Consequently, the GCO establishes a Gradient of Stability. Systems may inhabit deep, robust wells of closure (high meaningful existence/integrity) or shallow, fragile basins (low integrity/transient existence).

**6.6 Conclusion regarding the GCO**

The GCO formalizes the "stopping condition" of ontology. It asserts that reality is not an infinite regress of rules, but a landscape of stable, self-consistent structures. It provides the mathematical guarantee that the six primitives can cohere into persistent entities—atoms, organisms, and minds—that possess the integrity to resist dissolution.

**Appendix A: Detailed Clustering Process**

This appendix documents the full derivation from ~30 relationship types to six relational primitives, including extraction tables, clustering decisions, and alternative groupings considered.

**A.1 Stage 1: Subdomain Decomposition and Internal Relationship Mapping**

For each physical domain (Matter, Energy, Spacetime), we first mapped internal relational structures.

**Matter Domain Internal Relationships**

| **Subdomain** | **Internal Relationships** |
| --- | --- |
| Baryonic Matter | Compositional (quarks → hadrons → nuclei → atoms), interaction (electromagnetic binding), emergent (bulk properties from quantum statistics) |
| Antimatter | Symmetry (CPT pairing with matter), interaction (annihilation), structural (identical composition rules) |
| Leptonic Matter | Interaction (weak force couplings, electromagnetic for charged leptons), compositional (appears in atoms), transformation (decay processes) |
| Dark Matter | Gravitational coupling, minimal electromagnetic interaction, unknown compositional structure |
| Quantum Fields | Structural (matter as field excitations), dynamical (field evolution), symmetry (gauge structure), informational (quantum state space) |

**Energy Domain Internal Relationships**

| **Subdomain** | **Internal Relationships** |
| --- | --- |
| Kinetic Energy | Dynamical (motion-dependent), transformational (exchanges with potential), conserved (in closed systems) |
| Potential Energy | Structural (position-dependent), transformational (converts to kinetic), constraining (defines allowed configurations) |
| Radiation | Dynamical (propagating waves), informational (carries encoded information), transformational (emission/absorption) |
| Field Energy | Structural (stored in field configurations), dynamical (field evolution), coupling (sources other fields) |
| Dark Energy | Global (uniform across space), constraining (drives accelerated expansion), mysterious (unknown origin) |
| Vacuum Energy | Structural (ground state energy), quantum (zero-point fluctuations), constraining (Casimir effect) |

**Spacetime Domain Internal Relationships**

| **Subdomain** | **Internal Relationships** |
| --- | --- |
| 4D Manifold | Structural (differentiable topology), geometric (supports metric), causal (temporal ordering) |
| Metric Tensor | Geometric (defines distances), causal (defines light cones), dynamical (evolves with matter distribution) |
| Curvature | Geometric (deviation from flatness), dynamical (responds to stress-energy), constraining (geodesic paths) |
| Stress-Energy Tensor | Coupling (matter-geometry bridge), constraining (conservation laws via Bianchi identities) |
| Causal Structure | Geometric (light cones), constraining (no FTL), informational (limits knowledge propagation) |
| Quantum Spacetime | Speculative (discrete structure), emergent (classical spacetime as limit), foundational (possibly replaces continuum) |

**A.2 Stage 2: Cross-Domain Relational Extraction**

Relationships appearing in multiple domains or bridging domains were extracted. This produced approximately 30 types:

1. **Identity/Structural** - What defines an entity (appears in M, E, S)
2. **Compositional** - Part-whole relationships (M, E)
3. **Emergent** - Higher-level arising from lower (M, E, S)
4. **Interaction** - Direct coupling between entities (M, E)
5. **Transformation** - One type becoming another (M, E, S)
6. **Evolution/Dynamical** - Time-dependent change (M, E, S)
7. **Coupling** - Strength of interaction (M, E)
8. **Force/Influence** - Causal push/pull (M, E, S)
9. **Embedding** - Existing within larger structure (M in S, E in S)
10. **Geometric** - Spatial/metric structure (S, applicable to M and E configurations)
11. **Curvature** - Deviation from flatness (S, affects M and E)
12. **Causal** - Influence propagation (S, affects M and E behavior)
13. **Topological** - Global/nonlocal structure (S, M configurations)
14. **Symmetry** - Transformation invariance (M, E, S)
15. **Conservation** - Preserved quantities (M, E, S)
16. **Constraint** - Rules limiting possibilities (M, E, S)
17. **Gauge Invariance** - Symmetry of description (M, E, S)
18. **Duality** - Equivalent descriptions (M, E, S in various theories)
19. **Measurement** - Observer-system interaction (M, E, S)
20. **Uncertainty** - Limits on knowledge (M, E, S)
21. **Entropy** - Disorder/information measure (M, E, S via black holes)
22. **Information Flow** - Knowledge propagation (M, E, S)
23. **Decoherence** - Quantum-classical transition (M, E)
24. **Observability** - What's accessible to measurement (M, E, S)
25. **Computation** - Information processing capacity (M, E, S)
26. **Functorial/Meta-mapping** - Structure-preserving maps between theories (M-E-S connections)
27. **Renormalization** - Scale-dependent effective description (M, E)
28. **Correspondence** - Classical limit, duality relations (M, E, S)
29. **Recursive** - Self-similar or self-referential structure (M, E, S)
30. **Modal/Counterfactual** - Possible vs. actual (M, E, S)

**A.3 Stage 3: Functional Clustering**

We grouped these 30 types by asking: "What functional role does this relationship serve?"

**Cluster 1: ONTOLOGICAL**

**Functional role**: Defines what entities are, their identity, structure, and existence conditions

**Included types**:

- Identity/Structural (#1)
- Compositional (#2)
- Emergent (#3)
- Modal/Counterfactual (#30)

**Rationale**: All answer "what is X?" or "what exists?" even if the mathematics differs between domains.

**Alternative considered**: Separating emergence as distinct primitive **Rejected because**: Emergence is definable through composition + dynamical evolution + constraints

**Cluster 2: DYNAMICAL**

**Functional role**: Defines how entities change, interact, and evolve

**Included types**:

- Interaction (#4)
- Transformation (#5)
- Evolution/Dynamical (#6)
- Coupling (#7)
- Force/Influence (#8)
- Recursive (#29)

**Rationale**: All answer "how does X change?" or "what does X do?" Includes both deterministic and stochastic evolution.

**Alternative considered**: Splitting interaction from evolution **Rejected because**: Interaction IS a form of coupled evolution; functionally equivalent

**Cluster 3: GEOMETRIC/CAUSAL**

**Functional role**: Defines where/when entities exist and how influence propagates

**Included types**:

- Embedding (#9)
- Geometric (#10)
- Curvature (#11)
- Causal (#12)
- Topological (#13)

**Rationale**: All answer "where/when is X?" or "how does influence flow?" In GR, geometry and causality are inseparable.

**Alternative considered**: Splitting geometry from causality **Rejected because**: In relativity, geometric structure IS causal structure (metric defines light cones)

**Cluster 4: SYMMETRIC/CONSTRAINT**

**Functional role**: Defines rules, invariants, and what's forbidden/required

**Included types**:

- Symmetry (#14)
- Conservation (#15)
- Constraint (#16)
- Gauge Invariance (#17)
- Duality (#18)

**Rationale**: All answer "what rules govern X?" Via Noether's theorem, symmetries and conservation are equivalent. Gauge invariance is symmetry of description. Dualities are constraint-preserving re-descriptions.

**Alternative considered**: Separating dualities as distinct **Rejected because**: Dualities are constraint-preserving maps, functionally part of symmetric structure

**Cluster 5: EPISTEMIC/INFORMATIONAL**

**Functional role**: Defines what can be known, measured, or computed

**Included types**:

- Measurement (#19)
- Uncertainty (#20)
- Entropy (#21)
- Information Flow (#22)
- Decoherence (#23)
- Observability (#24)
- Computation (#25)

**Rationale**: All answer "what can be known about X?" or "what information is accessible?" Includes both fundamental limits (uncertainty, horizons) and practical limits (decoherence).

**Alternative considered**: Splitting information from measurement **Rejected because**: Measurement and information are functionally equivalent (measurement = information gain)

**Cluster 6: META-RELATIONAL**

**Functional role**: Defines relationships between relational structures themselves

**Included types**:

- Functorial/Meta-mapping (#26)
- Renormalization (#27)
- Correspondence (#28)

**Rationale**: All answer "how do different relational frameworks relate to each other?" These are second-order: relationships about relationships.

**Alternative considered**: Distributing these among other primitives **Rejected because**: Cross-framework mappings cannot be expressed within any single framework; they require meta-level

**A.4 Stage 4: Minimality Verification**

For each primitive, we verified it cannot be removed without losing coverage:

**Remove Ontological**: Cannot express identity or compositional structure from dynamics alone. What-is is distinct from how-it-changes.

**Remove Dynamical**: Cannot express evolution or interaction from static structure. How-it-changes is distinct from what-it-is.

**Remove Geometric/Causal**: Cannot express embedding or influence propagation from internal object properties. Where/when is distinct from what/how.

**Remove Symmetric/Constraint**: Cannot derive conservation laws from dynamics alone (would violate Noether's theorem). Forbidden/required is distinct from what-happens.

**Remove Epistemic/Informational**: Cannot derive measurement limits or uncertainty from ontology or dynamics alone. What's knowable is distinct from what-exists.

**Remove Meta-Relational**: Cannot express cross-framework correspondences within any single framework. How-frameworks-relate is distinct from any single framework's content.

**A.5 Alternative Clusterings Considered**

Several alternative clusterings were evaluated:

**Alternative 1: Seven Primitives (Split Geometry and Causality)**

**Rejected**: In general relativity, geometric structure and causal structure are unified through the metric. Splitting them would artificially separate what physics treats as one structure.

**Alternative 2: Five Primitives (Merge Ontological and Dynamical)**

**Rejected**: What-is and how-it-changes serve distinct functional roles. Many systems have well-defined ontology but unknown dynamics, or well-defined dynamics on unclear ontological substrate.

**Alternative 3: Eight Primitives (Add Emergence and Computation as separate)**

**Rejected**:

- Emergence is decomposable as composition + dynamical evolution + constraints
- Computation is a specific mode of information processing, covered by Epistemic/Informational

**Alternative 4: Four Primitives (Merge Symmetric/Constraint with Dynamical)**

**Rejected**: Constraints and dynamics have opposite logical structure:

- Dynamics: "what happens"
- Constraints: "what cannot happen" These are functionally distinct even though they interact.

**A.6 Robustness Check: Domain Coverage Matrix**

Final verification that each primitive covers relationships in multiple domains:

| **Primitive** | **Matter** | **Energy** | **Spacetime** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ontological | ✓ Particle identity, compositional structure | ✓ Forms of energy, potential wells | ✓ Manifold points, geometric objects |
| Dynamical | ✓ Interactions, decay, scattering | ✓ Transformation, flow, exchange | ✓ Geodesic evolution, curvature dynamics |
| Geometric/Causal | ✓ Spatial configuration | ✓ Field embedding | ✓ Metric, curvature, light cones |
| Symmetric/Constraint | ✓ CPT, gauge symmetry | ✓ Energy conservation | ✓ Diffeomorphism invariance |
| Epistemic/Informational | ✓ Quantum measurement | ✓ Thermodynamic entropy | ✓ Holographic principle, horizons |
| Meta-Relational | ✓↔︎E: Mass-energy equivalence | ✓↔︎S: Stress-energy → curvature | M↔︎E↔︎S: Einstein equations |

All primitives appear in all three domains or bridge them, confirming cross-domain validity.

# Formalizing the Relational Primitives: A Categorical Semantics

**Abstract Formulation:**
Let any physical domain be represented by a category $\mathcal{C}$ (or a hierarchy of categories). We posit that a complete physical description requires the category to possess specific structures that correspond to the six relational primitives derived in [Author's Paper].

We define a physical theory $\mathcal{T}$ as a tuple of structures over $\mathcal{C}$:
$$ \mathcal{T} = (\mathcal{C}, \otimes, \text{Hom}, \mathcal{G}, \mathcal{K}_T, \mathcal{F}) $$

### 1. The Ontological Primitive $\rightarrow$ Objects ($\text{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$)

In CT, ontology is defined not by intrinsic essence, but by the existence of objects as domains and codomains for morphisms.

- **Formalism:** Let $A, B \in \text{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ be physical systems.
- **Composition:** Composite entities (atoms from particles) are defined via the **Monoidal Product** $\otimes$. If $A$ is a quark and $B$ is a quark, the proton is $A \otimes B \otimes C$.
- **Identity:** For every object $A$, there exists a unique identity morphism $id_A: A \to A$ which represents the persistence of the ontological entity.

> Mapping: The "Ontological" primitive corresponds to the set of Objects $\text{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ and the Associativity Isomorphisms of the tensor product.
> 

### 2. The Dynamical Primitive $\rightarrow$ Morphisms ($\text{Hom}_\mathcal{C}$)

Dynamics are the arrows connecting objects.

- **Formalism:** A transition, evolution, or interaction is a morphism $f: A \to B$.
- **Time Evolution:** A specific endomorphism $U_t: A \to A$ parameterized by time $t$.
- **Interaction:** A morphism mapping a composite system to a new state, $\phi: A \otimes B \to C$.
- **Action:** The composition of morphisms $g \circ f$ corresponds to sequential dynamical events.

> Mapping: The "Dynamical" primitive corresponds to the Hom-sets of the category.
> 

### 3. The Geometric/Causal Primitive $\rightarrow$ Monoidal Structure & Causal Ordering

Geometry in CT is defined by how objects are "wired" together (embedding) and the strictness of information flow (causality).

- **Geometry (Embedding):** Defined by the **Monoidal Structure** $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, I)$. The graphical calculus of the category (string diagrams) represents the topological embedding of processes in spacetime.
- **Causality:** We impose a **Causal Structure** on $\mathcal{C}$. A process $f$ is "causal" if it satisfies the *no-signaling from the future* condition.
    - Let $\top$ be the terminal object (the deletion of information).
    - A map $f$ is causal if $\top_B \circ f = \top_A$ (marginalizing the output discards the input, preserving normalization).
    - Light cones are defined by the partial ordering of morphisms compatible with the tensor structure.

> Mapping: The "Geometric/Causal" primitive corresponds to the Symmetric Monoidal structure ($\otimes$) and the Terminal Object ($\top$) preservation conditions.
> 

### 4. The Symmetric/Constraint Primitive $\rightarrow$ Groupoids & Limits

Constraints act as filters on the allowed dynamics; symmetries act as equivalences between descriptions.

- **Symmetries:** These are the **Isomorphisms** in $\mathcal{C}$. The "Core" of the category, $\text{Core}(\mathcal{C})$, is the subcategory containing all objects but only invertible morphisms (isomorphisms). Gauge symmetries are Natural Transformations between identity functors.
- **Constraints:** These are formalized as **Limits** (specifically Equalizers).
    - If $f: A \to B$ is a dynamic process and $c: A \to B$ is a constraint condition (e.g., "energy must be zero"), the physically allowed state space is the Equalizer $E \xrightarrow{e} A$ such that $f \circ e = c \circ e$.
    - Conservation laws arise from the commutativity of diagrams involving symmetry generators.

> Mapping: The "Symmetric/Constraint" primitive corresponds to the Core Groupoid (invertible maps) and Finite Limits (Equalizers/Pullbacks).
> 

### 5. The Epistemic/Informational Primitive $\rightarrow$ The Kleisli Category (Monads)

Information and measurement involve uncertainty and side effects (collapse, entropy). This requires extending the category $\mathcal{C}$ using a **Monad** $T$.

- **Formalism:** Let $T$ be a probability or distribution monad (e.g., the Giry monad).
- **Measurement:** A measurement is not a map $A \to B$, but a map $A \to T(B)$ (a map from a system to a probability distribution over outcomes).
- **The Epistemic Realm:** We work in the **Kleisli Category** $\mathcal{C}_T$.
    - Objects are physical systems.
    - Morphisms are probabilistic/informational channels.
- **Entropy:** Defined as a functional on the morphisms in $\mathcal{C}_T$ measuring the loss of information (non-invertibility).

> Mapping: The "Epistemic" primitive corresponds to the Kleisli Category $\mathcal{C}_T$ of a Probability Monad $T$, representing the "accessible" or "observable" universe.
> 

### 6. The Meta-Relational Primitive $\rightarrow$ Functors & Adjunctions

This primitive describes relationships *between* theories (e.g., Quantum $\to$ Classical, or Gravity $\leftrightarrow$ Gauge Theory).

- **Formalism:** Let $\mathcal{Q}$ be the category of Quantum Mechanics and $\mathcal{Cl}$ be Classical Mechanics.
- **Correspondence:** A **Functor** $F: \mathcal{Q} \to \mathcal{Cl}$.
- **Emergence/Renormalization:** Often modeled as an **Adjunction** (a pair of functors $L \dashv R$).
    - $L$ (Left Adjoint): Coarse-graining / forgetting details.
    - $R$ (Right Adjoint): Embedding / approximation.
- **Duality:** An Equivalence of Categories $\mathcal{C} \cong \mathcal{D}$ (e.g., AdS/CFT).

> Mapping: The "Meta-Relational" primitive corresponds to Functors between distinct model categories ($F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$) and Natural Transformations between those functors.
