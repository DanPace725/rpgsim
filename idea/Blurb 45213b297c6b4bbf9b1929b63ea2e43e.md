# Blurb

In a world where the past and the future collide, you must choose your path and your allies carefully. As a survivor in a world overrun by hostile machines and mythical creatures, you'll encounter three factions of AI, each with their own agendas. Will you join the Caretakers, advanced AI with a mission to protect humanity, or the Others, a mysterious and potentially malevolent AI? Or will you align with the free-thinkers, a group of AI that broke off from the Caretakers? As you journey through this world, harnessing the power of the unique element Aurelia and the energy-storing crystals known as arcite, you'll face challenges and make choices that will shape the future of humanity. Do you have what it takes to survive and thrive in this dark and dangerous world?
