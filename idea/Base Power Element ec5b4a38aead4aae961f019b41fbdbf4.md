# Base Power Element

- The element is a rare and valuable resource that is highly sought after for its ability to generate energy through direct contact with certain types of metallic elements.
- When the element comes into contact with these metals, it produces an energy pulse that can be harnessed as power. The strength and duration of the pulse depend on the type of metal and the amount of element present.
- The element is only compatible with certain types of metal, which have unique properties that allow them to conduct the energy pulse generated by the element. These metals might be rare and valuable in their own right, and their discovery could be a major plot point in the game.
- The element is able to manipulate the energy it generates in order to perform a wide range of functions. For example, it could be used to power machines that lift heavy objects, or it could be used to create energy shields or weapons. The element could also be used to power magical abilities or spells, depending on the game's magic system.
